#About

A Laravel PHP project to track income and expenses and plan budgets.  Planned is integration with Plaid API to
retrieve information about customer accounts with ease.  A chart will be generated showing cash flow through user
accounts, and users will be able to track upcoming bills and information about upcoming recurring payments or
special financing plans.
